# Corebot Addons
This is the unofficial respretory for Corebot addons and commands.  Feel free to submit yours!  I am not accosiated with Revive in any way.

## What is Corebot?
Corebot is a self-hosted discord bot made by Revive.  You can buy it [here](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/8501/)!  Revive allows the comunity to upload their own commands and addons and uplad them in the respective folders, and this is for sharing them!

## How do I submit my addon/command?
You can submit it [here](https://github.com/evanspy1/corebotaddons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=submission.md&title=Submission).  I understand that you are submitting it as an issue but it is easier to manage since I can create a template.
